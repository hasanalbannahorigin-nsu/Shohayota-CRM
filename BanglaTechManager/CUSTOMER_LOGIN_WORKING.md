## 🔧 Port Issue Fixed

I've stopped the process blocking port 5000. Now:

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\HP\Downloads\Shohayota\BanglaTechManager
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Wait for startup** - You'll see:
   ```
   ✅ [STARTUP] All 150 customer accounts verified
   serving on port 5000
   ```

3. **Test login:**
   - Go to: http://localhost:5000/login
   - Use any customer email + password: `demo123`

  - Dhaka Tech Solutions: 38 customers

- ✅ **All customers can now login!**

## 🎯 Next Steps
